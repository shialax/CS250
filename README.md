How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs will start with an analysis of the system. In order for this to be done, we would need to ask the team for fedback and ask previous users for any errors or changes that they see within the code. Input and oupits should also be idenitified. User stories can assist with gathering this information because this is where users can express their needs and wants, and by looking at the user stories we can understand the end users perspectives.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

We can approach developing programs in multiple ways. Waterfall methodology is one way, which can help in projecting the needs of a specific strategy. Another method is agile, agile offers more flexible strategy and is an unique way to work with testing, planning and client integration
